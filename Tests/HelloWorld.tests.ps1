Describe the contents of the file `Tests/HelloWorld.tests.ps1`:

In this file, you can write assertions using Pester syntax to test the functionality of your code. Use the `Should` keyword followed by the desired condition to assert that a specific value or behavior is as expected. For example, you can use `Should -Be` to assert that a value is equal to an expected value, or `Should -Throw` to assert that a specific exception is thrown.

Here is the proposed contents of the file `Tests/HelloWorld.tests.ps1`:

```powershell
Describe "HelloWorld" {
    It "should return 'Hello, World!'" {
        $result = Invoke-HelloWorld
        $result | Should -Be "Hello, World!"
    }
}
```

Please note that the above code assumes you have a function named `Invoke-HelloWorld` that returns the string "Hello, World!". You can replace `Invoke-HelloWorld` with the actual function name you want to test and modify the assertion condition as per your requirements.
